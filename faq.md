## What is SNAP Hydroponics?

SNAP stands for Simple Nutrient Addition Program. It is a low-cost,
low-maintenance hydroponics system that is designed for household and
small-scale vegetable production.

## Where can I buy SNAP solutions?

You can buy them from UPLB-IPB and distributors. There are solutions being sold
and marketed as SNAP Hydroponics. Unfortunately the top hits when searching
the internet for SNAP hydroponics are selling illegitimate products. I'm still
waiting for a complete list of authorized distributors.

## Where can I buy seeds?

You can buy them from your local garden/agri centers. They are also available
in Ace Hardware.

## What do I do with the spent solution left in the reservoir after I harvest my crops?

You can use them to water you regular potted plants.

## What does SNAP A/B solution contain?

Please see the [MDS sheet](/files/Combined MSDS for SNAP A And B.pdf) for SNAP A/B solutions.

## Who are you?

I'm just a hobbyist SNAP grower who enjoys growing my own food with SNAP and wants to share the fun.
