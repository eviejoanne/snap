# Important Reminder

SNAP is a low-cost hydroponics system that is easy to setup and easy to maintain.
Growing plants with SNAP is a fun and rewarding hobby or business. However,
before you begin it is important to remember that a suitable location for your
SNAP hydroponics system is one of the most important factor to consider when
growing plants using SNAP Hydroponics.

In order to grow, plants require sufficient light. In addition, your SNAP
hydroponics system needs protection from rain. A suitable location for your SNAP
hydroponics system has the following characteristics:

* Receives sufficient sunlight and/or artificial lighting.
* Is protected from rain.

Examples:

* A fully enclosed greenhouse in a sunny location (ideal).

* An area that is covered by a transparent roof in a sunny location (less than
      ideal)

* An east facing area that receives early morning sunlight and is covered by an
awning (acceptable)

# Establish the Seedlings

## Required Materials

### Sowing Tray

Shallow box or basin with holes for drainage at the bottom. This can be
fashioned out of microwavable containers. Be sure to add drainage holes at the
bottom. It is important that you allow water to drain off the container,
otherwise seeds or seedlings will sit in water which can cause the seeds to rot
and the seedlings to drown.

It’s best to keep the lid since it can be used to keep the moisture in and help
with the seed germination. If you intend to use them add aeration holes on them
to allow some air to escape and circulate.

  at the bottom and on the lid.">
  <figcaption>A microwavable tub fashioned into a sowing tray.</figcaption>
</figure>

### Growing Media

There are a number of materials that can be used as growing media for seed raising.
In this manual we will use [coco coir]({{site.baseurl}}/coco-coir).

Regular potting mixes also works specially the ones designed for seed raising.
The use of soil that was dug up from the surroundings is not recommended because
it could be contaminated with pests and other pathogens.

<figure class="image is-2048x1365">
  <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/coco-coir.jpg" alt="A tub of hydrated coco coir.">
  <figcaption>Coco coir prepared from coco coir dehydrated bricks.</figcaption>
</figure>

### Seeds

These can be bought from local garden or agricultural center. For beginners, it
is strongly recommended to start with leafy vegetables such as lettuce, pechay,
mustasa or kangkong.

<figure class="image is-1536x2048">
  <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/seed-packet-display.jpg"
  alt="A shop display case with various seed packets shown.">
  <figcaption>A typical selection of seeds that can be found in gardening and agri-vet centers.</figcaption>
</figure>

## Procedure

1. Fill the sowing tray with a layer of moist coco coir around an inch thick.

2. Pack and level the coco coir.

3. Spread the seeds uniformly and thinly over the coco coir. For reference, a
pinch of small seeds (lettuce seeds for example) contains around twenty (20) to
fifty (50) seeds. Be sure to consider the germination rate of your seeds which
is usually indicated in the seed packets.

    <figure class="image is-1536x2048">
      <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/seed-packet.jpg" alt="Back of a seed packet with the germination rate highlighted.">
      <figcaption>Back of a seed packet with the germination rate highlighted</figcaption>
    </figure>

4. Water liberally. How long the seed will take to germinate is usually indicated
on the sowing instructions printed on the seed packet. There are a number of
factors that can affect how long the seeds will take to germinate and the
germination rate. Depending on the freshness of the seeds first signs of
germination usually appear within the next twenty-four (24) to seventy-two (72)
hours with most of the seeds germinating one (1) to two (2) weeks.

5. Grow the seedlings for ten (10) days before transferring to individual
[seedling plugs](#seedling-plugs).

# Prepare Growing Boxes

## Required Materials

### Styrobox

Boxes made of expanded polystyrene (EPS) known commonly as “styrofoam box” or
simply “styrobox” makes excellent materials for growing boxes. The *de facto*
size for styrofoam grow boxes is 20"×16"×6". These boxes can hold 10 (ten) to
twelve (12) liters of nutrient solution and has enough room to grow up to eight
(8) leafy vegetables and up to five (5) fruiting vegetables. Styroboxes of this
size are used to transport US imported grapes and are typically common during the
months of September to January. For details please see this
[styrobox guide]({{site.baseurl}}/styro-boxes).

### Lining Material

Styrofoam boxes has ventilation holes running along the edges. In order for the
bottom half of the box to hold the nutrient solution it must be lined with a
sturdy waterproofing sheet. This manual we will use 20 ✕ 30 inch polyethylene (PE)
plastic bags 

<figure class="image is-2048x992">
<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/20-by-30-pe-plastic-bag.jpg"
alt="A bag of polyethylene (PE) plastic bag with dimensions and number of contents indicated.">
<figcaption>A typical brand of 20 ✕ 30 inch PE plastic bags.</figcaption>
</figure>

### Styrofoam Puncher
  
A tool is required to make holes on the upper half of the grow box for the
[seedling plugs](#seedling-plugs). A tin can of the appropriate diameter
for the seedling plug can be made into such a styrofoam puncher. For details
please see this [guide on making DIY styrofoam puncher]({{site.baseurl}}/styrofoam-puncher).

### Packaging Tape

This will be used to hold the lining material in place and optionally cover the
ventilation holes.

### Bamboo Stick

A bamboo stick or similar implement is used to draw guidelines on the styrofoam.
It is also used to safely remove the styrofoam piece from the hole making tool
after each cut.

## Procedure

1. Turn the upperhalf of the styrobox over and place it on a flat surface. You
may also put a piece of plywood or cardboard in between the surface and the 
styrofoam to prevent the surface from being damaged by hole making tool during
the cutting step of the procedure.

2. Draw guide lines connecting the ventilation holes from opposite sides of the box
(illustrated below). A hole should be made centered where the lines cross.

    <figure class="image is-2048x1366">
      <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/grow-box-top-guide.jpg"
      alt="Upper half of the grow box showing how the guidelines are drawn.">
      <figcaption>Lines connecting ventilation holes in opposite sides. A hole is made where they
      intersect.</figcaption>
    </figure>

3. To make holes put the sharp end of the tool on the styrofoam and apply pressure
to score the surface. Hold the tool by the handles and apply pressure while moving
the tool in clockwise and counter clockwise direction making tool cut deeper
through the foam. Continue this process until the tool cuts through the foam.

4. Gently pull out the hole making tool. A circular piece of foam will be left on
one end of the tool. Use the stick to safely push one side of the piece into the
tool. This will cause piece to rotate and the other side be pushed  out of the
tool allowing you to safely grab and pull it out the styrofoam piece from the
hole making tool.

5. Repeat this process to create the rest of the holes.

6. It is strongly recommended that you use packing tape to cover the ventilation
on this half of the styrobox. This will deny mosquitoes access to the nutrient
solution and stop them from breeding in the grow box.

7. Line the lower half of the styrobox with the PE plastic bag. For detailed
instructions please see this guide on [how to line the grow box]({{site.baseurl}}/lining-growbox).

# Prepare Seedling Plugs

## Required Materials

### Styrofoam Cups

In this guide we will use eight ounce (8oz.) styrofoam cups pictured below.

<figure class="image is-1536x2048">
  <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/styro-cup.jpg"
   alt="An 8oz. styrofoam cup along side a measuring tape">
  <figcaption>A typical 8oz. styrofoam cup.</figcaption>
</figure>

### Small Hand Saw or Similar

This is used this to cut slits at the bottom of the styro cups.

### Established Seedlings

Please see [section on establishing seedlings](#establish-seedlings).

### Growing Media

There are a number of materials that can be used as growing media. In this manual
we will use [coco coir]({{site.baseurl}}/coco-coir).

### Plastic Spoon, BBQ Stick or Similar Implements

This is used to uproot seedlings from the sowing tray. This is also used to digging
implement when transferring the seedlings to the seedling plugs.

### Procedure

1. Using a handsaw make 5 to 8 slits vertical slits on the side of the cup starting
from the bottom. It should be two-thirds of along the side of the cup and about
one-third the radius of the bottom of the cup.

    <figure class="image is-768x768">
      <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/seedling-plug-bottom.jpg"
      alt="Bottom of seedling plug with slits running along the side and bottom.">
      <figcaption>Bottom of seedling plug with slits running along the side and bottom.</figcaption>
    </figure>

2. Add coco coir to the prepared styro cups. One-fourth to one-third the volume
of the cup is sufficient—just enough to support the seedling upright. The lesser
the better because the less growing media there is in the cup the faster it is
for the roots to find its way to the nutrient solution.

3. Transplant the seedlings from the sowing tray to the cups. Use a stick or a
similar implement to uproot the seedlings from the sowing tray with care. “Dig”
a hole in the middle of the growing media in the cup using a stick or similar
implement. Transfer only one seedling per cup. Make the transferred seedling
stand firmly by moving the growing media around the base of the seedling using
a stick.

4. If desired, the seedlings in the seedling plugs can be *hardened off* before
they are transferred to the growing boxes. Let the prepared seedling plug sit
in a shallow pool of diluted [working solution]({{site.baseurl}}/snap-working-solution)
for a few days.

# Assembling and Maintaining the SNAP Hydroponics System

## Materials Needed

### SNAP Nutrient Solution for Hydroponics

The SNAP Hydroponics system requires the use of SNAP nutrient solution. They are
developed and manufactured in UPLB-IPB and are distributed by
[SNAP authorized-resellers]({{ site.baseurl }}/authorized-resellers).

### Seedling Plugs

Please see [section on seedling plugs](#prepare-seedling-plugs).

### Growing Boxes

Please see [section on grow boxes](#prepare-grow-boxes).

### Clean Water

Deep well and regular tap water works well. SNAP is designed for use with water
from typical water sources in the Philippines. Using water that has gone through
reverse osmosis (*distilled water*) works against SNAP’s working parameters and
the resulting nutrient mixture will not be suitable for hydroponics growing.

### Benches

Optional benches or stand where the growing boxes will be placed under a shelter.

### Shelter

Green house, rain shelter or roof awning facing east for the earliest and
longest sunlight possible.

## Procedure

1. Arrange the growing boxes in your shelter. Making sure that each one is leveled
and each one is receiving sufficient sunlight to power the plants’ growth.

2. Fill each grow box 10L of water.

    <figure class="image is-1024x768">
      <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/adding-water.jpg"
      alt="Water being poured on the bottom half of a grow box.">
      <figcaption>Adding 10L of clean water to the bottom half of the grow box.</figcaption>
    </figure>

3. Add 25 mL of SNAP A. Mix well. Add 25 ml of SNAP B. Mix well. Either SNAP A or 
SNAP B can be added to the water first but remember to **stir the mixture thoroughly**
in between adding the SNAP A/B nutrient solution. The resulting mixture is
called the *working solution*. For details please see
[SNAP working solution guide]({{site.baseurl}}/snap-working-solution}}).

    <figure class="image is-1024x768">
      <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/working-solution.jpg"
      alt="SNAP working solution displaying its cloudy and slightly yellow apperance.">
      <figcaption>A properly mixed SNAP working solution has a cloudy and slightly yellow
      appearance.</figcaption>
    </figure>

4. Join the upper and lower halves of the grow box together and make sure they
are properly locked into place. 

5. Insert a seedling plug to each holes on the upper half of the grow box. Make
sure the bottom of the cups is immersed in the solution by at least a centimeter.
If not add **plain water** until the proper water level is reached.

6. Examine the boxes for leaks and do troubleshooting.
 
7. Visit the set up every morning as early as you can to catch any insect larva
that may feed on the plants. The larva is active visible in the early morning.
After that they tend to hide and are harder to find.

8. Expect the working solution level to go down as the plants grow. Replenish
the solution when the working solution level becomes too low. Never allow it to
totally dry up. When replenishing the solution, **never** allow the level of
the solution to reach the bottom of the cup and submerge the aerial roots.
For details please see the
[replenishment guide]({{site.baseurl}}/working-solution-replenishment).
