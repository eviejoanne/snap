  <h1 id="important-reminder">Important Reminder</h1>

  <p><abbr title="Simple Nutrient Addition Program">SNAP</abbr> is a low-cost hydroponics system that is easy to setup and easy to maintain.
Growing plants with <abbr title="Simple Nutrient Addition Program">SNAP</abbr> is a fun and rewarding hobby or business. However,
before you begin it is important to remember that a suitable location for your
<abbr title="Simple Nutrient Addition Program">SNAP</abbr> hydroponics system is one of the most important factor to consider when
growing plants using <abbr title="Simple Nutrient Addition Program">SNAP</abbr> Hydroponics.</p>

  <p>In order to grow, plants require sufficient light. In addition, your <abbr title="Simple Nutrient Addition Program">SNAP</abbr>
hydroponics system needs protection from rain. A suitable location for your <abbr title="Simple Nutrient Addition Program">SNAP</abbr>
hydroponics system has the following characteristics:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Receives sufficient sunlight and/or artificial lighting.</li>
    <li>Is protected from rain.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Examples:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>A fully enclosed greenhouse in a sunny location (ideal).</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>An area that is covered by a transparent roof in a sunny location (less than
    ideal)</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>An east facing area that receives early morning sunlight and is covered by an
awning (acceptable)</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="required-materials">Required Materials</h2>

  <h3 id="sowing-tray">Sowing Tray</h3>

  <p>Shallow box or basin with holes for drainage at the bottom. This can be
fashioned out of microwavable containers. Be sure to add drainage holes at the
bottom. It is important that you allow water to drain off the container,
otherwise seeds or seedlings will sit in water which can cause the seeds to rot
and the seedlings to drown.</p>

  <p>It’s best to keep the lid since it can be used to keep the moisture in and help
with the seed germination. If you intend to use them add aeration holes on them
to allow some air to escape and circulate.</p>

  <h3 id="growing-media">Growing Media</h3>

  <p>There are a number of materials that can be used as growing media for seed raising.
In this manual we will use <a href="/coco-coir">coco coir</a>.</p>

  <p>Regular potting mixes also works specially the ones designed for seed raising.
The use of soil that was dug up from the surroundings is not recommended because
it could be contaminated with pests and other pathogens.</p>

  <figure class="image is-2048x1365">

</figure>

  <h3 id="seeds">Seeds</h3>

  <p>These can be bought from local garden or agricultural center. For beginners, it
is strongly recommended to start with leafy vegetables such as lettuce, pechay,
mustasa or kangkong.</p>

  <h2 id="procedure">Procedure</h2>

  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>Fill the sowing tray with a layer of moist coco coir around an inch thick.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Pack and level the coco coir.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Spread the seeds uniformly and thinly over the coco coir. For reference, a
pinch of small seeds (lettuce seeds for example) contains around twenty (20) to
fifty (50) seeds. Be sure to consider the germination rate of your seeds which
is usually indicated in the seed packets.</p>

    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Water liberally. How long the seed will take to germinate is usually indicated
on the sowing instructions printed on the seed packet. There are a number of
factors that can affect how long the seeds will take to germinate and the
germination rate. Depending on the freshness of the seeds first signs of
germination usually appear within the next twenty-four (24) to seventy-two (72)
hours with most of the seeds germinating one (1) to two (2) weeks.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Grow the seedlings for ten (10) days before transferring to individual

  <h1 id="prepare-growing-boxes">Prepare Growing Boxes</h1>

  <h2 id="required-materials-1">Required Materials</h2>

  <h3 id="styrobox">Styrobox</h3>

  <p>Boxes made of expanded polystyrene (<abbr title="Expanded Polystyrene">EPS</abbr>) known commonly as “styrofoam box” or
simply “styrobox” makes excellent materials for growing boxes. The <em>de facto</em>
size for styrofoam grow boxes is 20”×16”×6”. These boxes can hold 10 (ten) to
twelve (12) liters of nutrient solution and has enough room to grow up to eight
(8) leafy vegetables and up to five (5) fruiting vegetables. Styroboxes of this
size are used to transport US imported grapes and are typically common during the
months of September to January. For details please see this
<a href="/styro-boxes">styrobox guide</a>.</p>

  <h3 id="lining-material">Lining Material</h3>

  <p>Styrofoam boxes has ventilation holes running along the edges. In order for the
bottom half of the box to hold the nutrient solution it must be lined with a
sturdy waterproofing sheet. This manual we will use 20 ✕ 30 inch polyethylene (<abbr title="Polyethylene">PE</abbr>)
plastic bags</p>

  <figure class="image is-2048x992">
<img src="/assets/images/20-by-30-pe-plastic-bag.jpg" alt="A bag of polyethylene (PE) plastic bag with dimensions and number of contents indicated." />
<figcaption>A typical brand of 20 ✕ 30 inch <abbr title="Polyethylene">PE</abbr> plastic bags.</figcaption>
</figure>

  <h3 id="styrofoam-puncher">Styrofoam Puncher</h3>

  <p>A tool is required to make holes on the upper half of the grow box for the
<a href="#seedling-plugs">seedling plugs</a>. A tin can of the appropriate diameter
for the seedling plug can be made into such a styrofoam puncher. For details
please see this <a href="/styrofoam-puncher">guide on making DIY styrofoam puncher</a>.</p>

  <h3 id="packaging-tape">Packaging Tape</h3>

  <p>This will be used to hold the lining material in place and optionally cover the
ventilation holes.</p>

  <h3 id="bamboo-stick">Bamboo Stick</h3>

  <p>A bamboo stick or similar implement is used to draw guidelines on the styrofoam.
It is also used to safely remove the styrofoam piece from the hole making tool
after each cut.</p>

  <h2 id="procedure-1">Procedure</h2>

  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>Turn the upperhalf of the styrobox over and place it on a flat surface. You
may also put a piece of plywood or cardboard in between the surface and the 
styrofoam to prevent the surface from being damaged by hole making tool during
the cutting step of the procedure.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Draw guide lines connecting the ventilation holes from opposite sides of the box
(illustrated below). A hole should be made centered where the lines cross.</p>

      <figure class="image is-2048x1366">
   <img src="/assets/images/grow-box-top-guide.jpg" alt="Upper half of the grow box showing how the guidelines are drawn." />
   <figcaption>Lines connecting ventilation holes in opposite sides. A hole is made where they
   intersect.</figcaption>
 </figure>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>To make holes put the sharp end of the tool on the styrofoam and apply pressure
to score the surface. Hold the tool by the handles and apply pressure while moving
the tool in clockwise and counter clockwise direction making tool cut deeper
through the foam. Continue this process until the tool cuts through the foam.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Gently pull out the hole making tool. A circular piece of foam will be left on
one end of the tool. Use the stick to safely push one side of the piece into the
tool. This will cause piece to rotate and the other side be pushed  out of the
tool allowing you to safely grab and pull it out the styrofoam piece from the
hole making tool.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Repeat this process to create the rest of the holes.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>It is strongly recommended that you use packing tape to cover the ventilation
on this half of the styrobox. This will deny mosquitoes access to the nutrient
solution and stop them from breeding in the grow box.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Line the lower half of the styrobox with the <abbr title="Polyethylene">PE</abbr> plastic bag. For detailed
instructions please see this guide on <a href="/lining-growbox">how to line the grow box</a>.</p>

  <h3 id="procedure-2">Procedure</h3>

  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>Using a handsaw make 5 to 8 slits vertical slits on the side of the cup starting
from the bottom. It should be two-thirds of along the side of the cup and about
one-third the radius of the bottom of the cup.</p>

   <figcaption>Bottom of seedling plug with slits running along the side and bottom.</figcaption>
 </figure>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Add coco coir to the prepared styro cups. One-fourth to one-third the volume
of the cup is sufficient—just enough to support the seedling upright. The lesser
the better because the less growing media there is in the cup the faster it is
for the roots to find its way to the nutrient solution.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Transplant the seedlings from the sowing tray to the cups. Use a stick or a
similar implement to uproot the seedlings from the sowing tray with care. “Dig”
a hole in the middle of the growing media in the cup using a stick or similar
implement. Transfer only one seedling per cup. Make the transferred seedling
stand firmly by moving the growing media around the base of the seedling using
a stick.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>If desired, the seedlings in the seedling plugs can be <em>hardened off</em> before
they are transferred to the growing boxes. Let the prepared seedling plug sit
in a shallow pool of diluted <a href="/snap-working-solution">working solution</a>
for a few days.</p>

    <li>
      <p>Insert a seedling plug to each holes on the upper half of the grow box. Make
sure the bottom of the cups is immersed in the solution by at least a centimeter.
If not add <strong>plain water</strong> until the proper water level is reached.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Examine the boxes for leaks and do troubleshooting.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Visit the set up every morning as early as you can to catch any insect larva
that may feed on the plants. The larva is active visible in the early morning.
After that they tend to hide and are harder to find.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Expect the working solution level to go down as the plants grow. Replenish
the solution when the working solution level becomes too low. Never allow it to
totally dry up. When replenishing the solution, <strong>never</strong> allow the level of
the solution to reach the bottom of the cup and submerge the aerial roots.
