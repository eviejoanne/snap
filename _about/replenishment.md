An important part of maintaining your SNAP hydroponics system is the regular
replenishment of the SNAP nutrient solution. Overtime your plants will consume
the nutrient solution to power their growth. Below is a visual guide to
replenishing the SNAP nutrient solution.

When initially set up the bottom of the seedling plugs will be touching the
nutrient solution. Because of this the seedling will be water logged which will
force it to create aerial roots.

As the plant grows, roots will develop and the solution level will do down. The
plant will be able to "breath" in this manner some of the roots are exposed in
moist air and some of the roots are immersed in SNAP solution.

As the plant develops further, more of the solution will be consumed. It is
important to regularly check the nutrient solution level and **never let it dry
up**.

Add SNAP nutrient solution (2.5mL of SNAP A and B per liter of water) as needed.
**Do not** immerse the plants' root system in solution because they will "drown."
A good rule of thumb is to add solution so that the solution level is about a
centimeter from the bottom of the seedling plugs.
