## 0.0 Where to Buy SNAP Hydroponic Solutions

You can buy them from UPLB-IPB and authorized resellers. Unfortunately, the top
hits when searching the internet for SNAP hydroponics are selling products 
labeled “SNAP Hydroponics” but are not from UPLB-IPB. You can find a list of 
authorized resellers in the [authorized resellers list](http://snap-hydroponics.info/resellers).

## 1.0 Before Anything Else

SNAP is cheap, easy to set-up, easy to maintain and most of all a fun and
rewarding hobby. There are a number of set up guides you can read or watch over
the internet. This is just one of them. If you are reading intending to
start your own SNAP grow, I'll start by letting you know that **the most important
step in setting up your SNAP garden is finding a suitable location for your growing
boxes**. The location you choose must be protected from rain because rain can
seep into your growing boxes, dilute and waste your SNAP solution. It must also
receive sufficent sunlight. The amount of sunlight depends on the type of plant
you are planning to grow. There are also other considerations. Like, for example
enough room for your plants if you are growing fruiting vegetables or trellises
for crawling vines. For most of us, the best option will be an east facing roof
awning. If you can afford it, a greenhouse is be the best place for your SNAP
grow boxes.

Now that we have that out of the way. Let's get started. The following is guide
has been adapted from ["How to Set-Up SNAP Hydroponics"](/files/HOW TO SETUP.pdf)
by Primitivo Jose A.  Santos and Eureka Teresa M. Ocampo of the Institute of
Plant Breeding-CSC-CA, UP Los Baños.

## 2.0 Establish the Seedlings

### 2.1 Materials Needed

* **Sowing tray** - Shallow box or basin with holes for drainage at the bottom.
This can be fashioned out of microwavable containers. Just be sure to poke holes
at the bottom. It's best to keep the lid since it can be used to keep the moisture
in and help with the seed germination.

    ![a microwavable container](http://i.imgur.com/KSfuQ12h.jpg)

* **Growing media** - We have a number of options. If you are shopping for seeds,
I suggest you buy one of those urban gardening starter kits pictured below.

    ![urban gardening starter kit](http://i.imgur.com/OqAYF16h.jpg)

    They are usually suppied with seed starter growing medium. Plus they come in
    convenient boxes that you can fashion into a sowing tray. You can also use coco
    coir. You will probably have coco coir since it's needed else where in your set-up.
    For more information about coco coir please [see the guide](/guides/coco-coir.html).

    Regular potting mixes also works. I wouldn't recommend using soil that you dug up from
    your surroundings because it could be littered with pests and other nasties.

* **Seeds** - You can buy these from your garden or agricultural center. If you
are just getting started with SNAP I recommend starting with leafy vegetables
like pechay, mustasa or lettuce.

* **Water** - Plants needs this of course.

### 2.2 Procedure

1. Fill the sowing tray with a layer of growing media. About an inch thick will
do.

2. Level the growing media.
3. Scatter the seeds uniformly and thinly. The amount would depend on your needs.
Be sure to consider the germination rate of your seeds which is usually indicated
in the seeds' packets.

    ![indicated germ rate](http://i.imgur.com/11V0f7Fh.jpg)

4. Water liberally as needed. Expect germination in 3 to 5 days.
5. Grow the seedlings for 10 days before transfering to individual [seedling plugs](#seedling-plugs).

## 3.0 Prepare the Growing Boxes {#growing-boxes}

### 3.1 Materials Needed

* **Styrofoam boxes** - These are boxes used as containers for grapes. They come in
various sizes. The size I'd recommend is 20"×14"×6". This size has enough room
for up to 8 leafy vegetables and up to 5 fruiting vegetable. It can hold 10-12
liters of SNAP solution. For details check out [the styro box guide](/guides/styro-boxes.html).

* **Lining material** - The styro boxes has ventilation holes running along the
edges. They must be lined with a sturdy waterproof sheet if they are to hold our
SNAP solution. There are a number of options depending on which materials are
available to you. I use 100cm×100cm plastic bags that are used to line styro
boxes used in fish trade. They cost ₱20 each and is enough for three 20"×14"×6" styro
boxes.

* **"A tool for making holes"** - We need a tool to make holes on our
growing boxes for our [seedling plugs](#seedling-plugs). A tin can of the appropriate diameter
for your styro cups with one end opened will do. If you have it, a hole saw works
well. For details checkout [this guide](/guides/diy-tools.html).

* **Heavy duty packaging tape**  - There are numerous options. Your growing boxes
will be exposed to the elements so I advise not skimpping on your tape.

### 3.2 Procedure

1. Use your tool of choice to bore holes at the top part of your styrobox.  Your
holes should be equidistant from each other.

2. Line the bottom part of the styrobox with your lining material so I can hold
the SNAP solution. Use the packing tape to secure the lining material.

    ![a plastic lined styro box](http://i.imgur.com/CkIqYp7h.jpg)

3. If you don't have a greenhouse, it is recommended that you use packing tape
to cover the ventilation holes at the top part of the styrobox. This will prevent
mosquitoes from breeding in your growing box.

## 4.0 Prepare the seedling plugs {#seedling-plugs}

### 4.1 Materials Needed

1. **Styrofoam cups** - Eight to twelve ounce styrofoam cups works well.
2. **Box cutter, knife or hack saw blade** - We use this to cut slits at the
bottom of our styro cups.
3. **Growing media** [Coco coir](/guides/coco-coir.html) is probably the easiest to work with and most
accessible. They are sold as bricks which expands to 8 to 10L when hydrated.
They are available in most garden or agri centers. Other options include
carbonized rice hull, vermiculite, sand, saw dust and mixtures thereof.

    ![coco coir](http://i.imgur.com/n5YkyLmh.jpg)

4. Plastic spoon, BBQ stick or similar.

### 4.2 Procedure

1. Use a knife, saw blade or box cutter to make 5 to 8 narrow slits (about 1
inch long at the side and ½ inch at the bottom).

    ![a seedling plug](http://i.imgur.com/UdxzWy3h.jpg)

2. Fill (about a third full) the prepared styro cups with the growing media. We
need not fill the entire cup because we need to roots to make its way to the
SNAP solution rather than circle around the cup.

3. Transplant the seedlings from the sowing tray. "Dig" a hole in the middle of
the growing media in the cup using a stick or the handle of a plastic spoon. Use
a stick or the a plastic spoon to uproot the seedlings from the sowing tray with
care. Transfer only one seedling per cup.  Make the transferred seedling stand 
firmly by replacing the "dug" media to the base of the seedling. For details
please see the [transplanting guide](/guides/transplanting.html).

## 5.0 Running the SNAP hydroponics system

### 5.1 Materials Needed

1. **[Seedling plugs](#seedling-plugs)**

2. **[Growing Boxes](#growing-boxes)**

3. **Water** - Tap water will do. If your water is chlorinated let it sit overnight
before use.

3. **Benches** - *Optional* benches or stand where the growing boxes will be placed under a
shelter.

4. **Shelter** - Green house, rain shelter or roof awning facing east for the earliest and
longest sunlight possible.


### 5.2 Procedure
1. Arrange the growing boxes in your shelter.

2. Fill each growing box with water. You need to add enough water to immerse
the bottom ½ inch of the styrocups in SNAP solution. Check by putting back the
lid, putting a seedling in one of the holes and examining the water level. If
you are using a 20"×14"×6" styrobox, 12L should be enough.

    ![water being poured to styrobox](http://i.imgur.com/k0fCccwh.jpg)

3. Add 2.5 mL (½ teaspoon) of SNAP A for each liter of water in your growing box.
Stir well. Add an equal amount of SNAP B to then stir well.

    ![SNAP solution ready](http://i.imgur.com/QXGg72Uh.jpg)

4. Put back the cover of the box and place the seedling plugs into the holes of
the cover.

    ![growing box ready](http://i.imgur.com/uoDugiih.jpg)

5. Examine the boxes for leaks and make some troubleshooting.
 
6. Visit the set up every morning as early as you can to catch any insect larva
that may feed on the plants. The larva is visible in the early morning. After
that they tend to hide already and are harder to find.

7. Replenish the solution when more than one inch from the cup bottom has been
depleted. Expect the nutrient solution level to go down when the plants are much
bigger than when they were still small seedlings. When replenishing the solution,
 **never** allow the level of the solution to reach the bottom of the cup.
Replenish until about ½ inch below the cup’s bottom. For a visual guide please
see the [replenishment guide](/guides/replenishment.html).
